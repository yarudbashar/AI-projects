i love this album. it's very good. more to the hip hop side than her current pop sound.. SO HYPE! i listen to this everyday at the gym! i give it 5star rating all the way. her metaphors are just crazy.
Good flavor. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Good flavor.
"I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess."
My husband bought this gel for us. The gel caused irritation and it felt like it was burning my skin. I wouldn't recommend this gel.
My boyfriend and I bought this to spice things up in the bedroom and we were both highly disappointed in this product. We bought this one because we absolutely love the ky yours and mine and we thought this would have a similar affect but it did absolutely nothing. Do not buy.
Bought this earlier today and was excited to check it out. Based on the product description I was expecting something but it was just like the regular KY. We are fans of the his and hers so we just expected more and were left a little disappointed.
I bought this product for my husband and I to try and we were not impressed at all. There was no tingling or warming. It left us both very sticky. I have used KY products in the past (loved KY his and hers) but this one was disappointing.
My husband and I bought this for some extra fun. We werevboth extremely disappointed. Especially for the price! Do not waste your money on this product. We felt nothing but a sticky mess from it.
Got as a surprise for my husband there is nothing special about it just a lube save the money and get plain KY if you just need a lube wish I could return it for a refund
tried it with my husband and felt no different there was no effect no change first te using ky gel not sure if i want to try any others...
Purchased this thinking it would have some sort of warming effect but it's the same as the original. Don't waste your money.
"Bought this to enhance our time a bit, did abslutely nothing very disappointed especially because its almost 20!"
I bought this after really liking the his n hers variety but this is nothing like that very disappointed with this product.
First time purchase of this type of product. Maybe I expected too much. Did not think there was any warming feeling at all. Left us sticky! Even after trying to was it off.
I bought this and tried this with my wife but we did not enjoy it ..we did not feel anything enhancement with this product at all such as the his-her product.
I bought this product to spice things up with my fianc and it didn't do anything! No passion. Will not buy again
"I bought this to try to spice things up, but I felt nothing. Very disappointing to be honest."
"I bought this because it had better reviews than the his and hers jelly, but I feel like it didn't work that well for us. It was kind of warm-feeling, but that's about it. I guess I don't know what's supposed to happen! Lol"
It was my first time using k-y. It didn't do anything in my opinion it felt like every time we did anything. Then again was my first time so probably did Somthing wrong.
"I noticed this product on clearance at a store I shop frequently and decided to give it a try. My husband and I LOVE it! We went back and bought every box left! I, like others have mentioned, am not sure what it is supposed to do other than be a lubricant but for that purpose we like it much better than regular KY Jelly (which tends to dry out and disappear for us). This product stays on for awhile and makes for a very pleasurable experience. The only drawback is that we find it to be a bit sticky. After applying it with your hands you're left with a sticky hand and I agree a little goes a long way! I personally have to be very careful with all products due to skin irritation and surprisingly this actually seems to help that. I did NOT receive a sample and never have."
I used this product a couple of times since i recived it free to try and it has been a good experiance it feel warm so its a pretty good sensation so i recomend.
"Used a few times stays a bit sticky but not too bad, better than most products"
Loved This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This is a good product. Will give you a great feeling.
"I really enjoyed using this product with my husband. After 20+ years of marriage, things can tend to get a little tired and boring. This was just the thing we needed to shake things up a bit. The packaging and pump dispenser is awesome. The product itself does not disappoint. A little goes a very long way. It provides a slight warming sensation when in use and does not become sticky or tacky in anyway. This is an excellent choice for an intimate lubricant. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100 my own."
Awesome Product for couples. It is a warm feeling lubricant and not sticky like a lot of other lubricants.It is very easy to clean up after use.I will absolutely be purchasing more in the future. I received this product free for the purpose to give my review..Opinions are 100 my own!
"Exceptional product, this is smooth, not slimy and the warming sensation is an experience that both partners should share at least once in their lifetime. Great way to shake things up!"
I used this for the first time with my boyfriend and he loved it just as much as I did. Didn't get sticky and felt great the entire time.
Great product! Exactly what it says works very well
"yes, the scent is the best. if you like lemon frosting you won't be able to get enough of this lotion. but also, it's almost 100 natural, none of the yucky ingredients like in major brands of lotion. no mineral oil, no petroleum, etc. but also, it completely works. you know how sometimes you opt for organic choices and it's good, but not as good as popular but nastier brands jr watkins delivers. this lotion softens your hands and body, leaves you ungreasy and smells perfect. even my fiance likes it and uses it and he's pretty much anti-lotion in all regards. the price is absolutely right, too--get it!"
"The Hand-Cream-Lemon-Cream has such a refreshing fragrance. I wish it would last all day. It is soothing to the hands and I get compliments when I use it especially from my daughters and granddaughters, they want me to get some for them It is one of my favorite hand creams. I wish Watkins still had the vanilla body cream that too was a favorite."
Smells like a lemon cookie. Absolutely love!!! My kids love it.
You will LOVE this lotion. I smile every time I put it on.
This hand cream is so nice that I had it on my desk at work and someone stole it after just two days! Broke my heart a little
"I love this lotion. Nice and thick, great fragrance. I use it on my hands and my feet."
Not sure how this works with clearing your complexion (been using for 2 weeks now) but does keep your skin smooth and clean.
Makes my skin feel clean and not super dry where its ashy if i dont follow with a moisturiser as soon as im done. The skin doesnt feel oily or tacky. Makes my skin more radiant and use of foundation and concealer is not needed to make the skin look even and hydrated.
It makes my face feel nice and fresh. After about 3 days i did get slight acne but it cleared right back up! Will deff use this every day from now on!
"I have used this soap for years and considered it Wal-Mart's best kept secret. I was so disappointed when they stopped carrying it in our store location. Was delighted to see I could get it online it ended up a blessing. I don't go to Wal-Mart as often so I'm saving money there (Sorry Walmart), delivery was prompt, I stockpiled and never left the house."
I WON'T recommend this product to anyone
"I did receive 1 bottle but when I ordered, it said a pack of 6. I was disappointed about that. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"You would think it's convenient to have bubble bath and wash in the same container, but it just means you buy twice the amount... My son loves the bubbles though so no complaints."
"Well, Johnson's need I say more I know, right. Ok, but I will. I have used Johnson's since I was a baby, yes it's been a long time. But let's get to the Chase, it's 2 in 1. Come on, who doesn't like 2 in 1 It's hard enough to get the little loves clean, so any help is always a blessing... So, Johnson's Bubble Bath and wash is a must have in this house!!!"

"The bubbles aren't over the top fabulous, but it smells good and makes the kids happy."
I ma using this for my baby when she is one month old. I don't like much fragnanaces hence i love it. I don't feel like using another one.
Lots of fun in the bath but have to use a lot to make it bubble! Nice addition when the kids don't want to take a bath.
I absolutely love this bubblebath. It smells so good and it body wash too. My little one has very sensitive skin so this is a great option for her to still enjoy bubbles and not break out.
I bought a small sample size of this a couple months back and loved it. The smell is just wonderful. I recently bought a new bottle and think that I may have to keep it in my shower and buy my kids another one!
Very pleasant smell. Only need a little for a whole lot of bubbles.
My babies love the bubbles and mom loves that is tear free and the fragrance
My son loves this product. Makes bath time more fun and looks forward to it. Not only is it bubbles but also body wash. The 2- in-1 makes it convenient for me
Really liked the fresh smell of this.
"I used (and loved) this product for several years until they changed it. It used to moisturize my skin and left it feeling soft. Now, it sits on top of my skin and is never absorbed. It just leaves a slimy film on my skin. I will no longer purchase this product."
"I have been using Oil of Olay for over 20 years. This product worked so well for me, but the new formula is HORRIBLE! I cannot find anything to work for my skin like it did! The smell is flowery and it is too thick. The old formula was so light"
"I am so disappointed! I have used this product for years because of it's soft smell and great results. The new formula feels greasy, smells awful and I don't feel like my skin looks as toned and wrinkle free anymore. This was a five star product for so many years...why change it Please bring back the old formula."
"I've been using this product for years and it was terrific. This improved formula is terrible. It doesn't have the hydrating power it had -- it's much thinner and stickier. Heaven help you if you get some on your lips - it tastes terrible! PLEASE dump this improved formula. Until then, I'm shopping for a new moisturizer... alas"
"It took me so long to find a moisturizer that worked well for me and I loved this product. However, this new formula has a smell that is too strong for me and feels very greasy once applied. Unfortunately I will no longer be purchasing this product and will have to search again for another moisturizer. Please Olay, bring back your old formula. It was so much better."
"Used to swear by this product as my daily moisturizer. I loved it because it felt thick and creamy and did a great job without being greasy or feeling heavy. However, just bought the first container of the new formula. It's terrible! It leaves a greasy feel that does not go away and makes it impossible to apply makeup, even 10 minutes after. Your skin just feels slimy to the touch, slippery. And the scent is way stronger. Please, OLAY, give us our old formula back!! I'll be purchasing something else."
Olay don't work for me I have overly dry skin. I haven't found anything to work on my skin. So I'm hoping to be able to find something that will work. But I'm affrid I won't be able to find anything to help my skin not be so dry. It gets so bad the I dig at my legs all the time.
I used it for several days in a row and I felt like I was wearing a mask. And my skin felt unnatural and dry under it. My skin felt coated instead of hydrated. I will not purchased this product again.
"I buy Olay Regenerist all the time from CVS and Rite Aid. This time around I purchased it from Wal Mart's online store, and when I received it, the formula was slightly different. The lotion smells like the cheaper products Olay makes. I am very disappointed and will not order from Walmart online again."
"my mother and i have vowed by this product for years and years... when i first started paying attention to skincare, she gave me a bottle of olay regenerist and it's all i've ever needed ... the only thing that works (and i have spent so much money exploring more high-end brands)! so you can understand why i'm upset that the formula was tampered with... this new and improved cream smells awful (the scent is way too strong), it appears that they've watered it down, it's mushy on my face and if i touch my face at any point during the day, it starts peeling off... it's greasy and does not work well under makeup at all! my mom and i are now forced to look for a whole new line of products when we've stayed with olay for our whole lives. sad, sad, sad. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!"
"While this product probably does leave faces feeling nourished, I would not recommend using it as a daily moisturizer under makeup. It left my face full of crumbles as soon as I brushed on my makeup. Would probably be better as a night cream."
Just didn't have the moisture I am used too. Thought I would try this but will go back to Nutragena
GreatGreatmefeels great smells great succulent took away dry skin silky smooth enriching
"Today is my first time using this product. Felt great going on immediately, felt moisturized without being too greasy. Although it smells great I would have loved to have this formula in a fragrance-free option, my skin tends to be a little sensitive to fragrances, but I will give a final review in a couple of weeks"
Love it. I can feel the result in few days. I will recommend it to my friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I use this at night for wrinkles on the face. It does a good job reducing wrinkles and taking a couple of years off your face. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Although this product worked amazingly well, the fragrance gave me headaches and made my eyes water daily-Olay please make more fragrance-free products."
"While I do love this product, having used it for at least 10 years, I prefer the old formulation better. I feel the new one doesn't hydrate as well, and leaves a thin film on my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
I want to try this so that I can answer these questions. It sounds like a product that would help my skin on my face. I just don't want my face to start sagging. I have always liked olay products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"This product really helped keep my skin moisturized in the winter months. I used it morning and night with good results. It's a little heavy for warmer weather though, with my skin type anyway. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
The product smells amazing need to use more often on my skin.
"I love the cleansers but this cream is a little too thick for me...I have trouble going to bed with it on...a bit greasy and has a lot of fragrance. I just purchased the micro sculping cream and I can't wait to try it tonight! One point though, this cream has lasted a very long time, though I don't use it every night becuase it's not my favorite."
I like the product but dislike the dispenser. With the hole in the top it is strange to dispense and leaves a mess on the top of the container. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I wake up feeling that it has moisturized my face but I honestly cannot tell if has done anything else. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I'm an avid Olay girl...this was not one of my favorites but ib would buy again

"Love the smell, and how supple my skin feels,I actually wakeup with less sleep wrinkles on my face from using thee night time moisture cream. I would use everything okay makes if I could afford to buy them."
Its good cause it works and that's all that matters. .
"product seems to work well, I haven't noticed any major antiaging qualities but does seem to help the acne"
I would recommend this product to those who don't have the money to spend on expensive lotions daily facial products. As we all know older we get we start showing signs of our real age. Olay has products for your every day concerns and cares. I've used Olay products off on for years.
smell good because it has a good smell and it should be put in more stores so people can buy it
This product works amazing because it not only makes my skin smell great it also keep my skin smooth n healty
I would def recommend this product! It smells so good and leave Susie skin soft.
"Great smell and feel, would like to try again in future. Thank you"
"I rated the Olay Micro-Sculpting fragrance free a one because it did not absorb and made foundation glob. It peeled as i rubbed. This formula is much better for day use. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I does hydrate well, haven't seen all my wrinkles dissappear yet. :)"
I did not like the way it felt on my skin. I felt like I had on some sort of a skin mask. It may be OK for some people. But not for me. The moisturizer does have a creamy texture to it.

Feels amazing made my skin feel great and not dry anymore .
I have enjoyed using a variety of the Olay products for more than 30 years and consider them to be part of my life routine-wherever I am. As an international traveler they always make me feel like I am being cared for regardless of where I am. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"Regenerist hydration cream is the best product I have found. It hydrates your face so that is feels baby soft, smooth's away fine lines. Fills in all the little imperfection's that you might have. I highly recommend this product for over 55. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product is amazing it doesn't dry my skin of moisture.
I started using this moisturizer when my sister told me about it. I could feel my dry skin softening over a few days. It didn't hurt when I smiled! That alone was a good reason to try it. Now I will even smile deliberately. It is a good feeling to to able to show I am not a grump!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
"I've tried many products including the over priced products claiming to work miracles. This product I like. It sinks into the skin and doesn't leave a shine. I would recommend it. I'll buy it again and since I like this product so much, I'm going to try some of their others in this line."
"This truly is a great product! It has a very clean smell, and it actually works for Fine Lines wrinkles"
Because they have use some kind of good fragnense in that
"I have been very pleased with this product from Olay. It truly does moisturize my very dry skin. It is easy to dispense the product by just pressing on the top of the container, and dispenses just the right amount per press. I would recommend Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream to anyone who has dry skin like mine. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My family is on a very tight budget, so spending 20 for facial cream was a big chunk out of my grocery . But this is well worth it. My rapidly maturing skin is getting smoother. I still have my wrinkles, but they are not so pronounced. I will watch for sales coupons, this is one product that I will keep using."
It smell just amazing and feels great on my skin and leave it feeling so soft.
I'm a 52 year old with dry skin and really need a cream that can hydrate me. when i use this cream i actually feel like me skin is saying Ahhhh. i'm really glad i found the whole Regenerist line.

"I use this at night and sometimes when I don't wear makeup during the day, I use it then too. Absorbs quickly, not sure now much it is actually helping me prevent more wrinkles, but smells good and feels good. not sticky. wish it worked even more against wrinkles. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"My overall opinion - it is a great cream if you do not have comedones or acne because one of the top ingredients is Dimethicone - a silicone based polymer. It is large molecule and may clog your pores, therefore the condition of your skin will get worse This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Then I tried the Regenerist and in a WEEK my skin was visibly softer, smoother and actually supple!! I CANNOT BELIEVE I have a soft face. You have to try this because if it made this drastic change in my rough, dry, peeling skin it will work on ANYONE!! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product makes me feel young and fresh because it opens up my pores and it allows me to breathe with some sort of comfort.

I have used the product since I was 16 I have tried others just not the same.my mom used it how I learned about it
This product has recently changed its formula. I have been using the old formula for years and probably prefer that formula over the new one but it is still too early to judge for certain. I definitely prefer the white dispenser top over the new black one since the residue looks very unappealing on a black surface. Does not look clean which is what you would want your facial products to represent. Overall I still like this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product is very good and smells sensational. I recommend for all who have ashy skin! I'm VSOP by nature . Very smooth On point skinn
This product is great because it is one of the best moisturizers I have found
"I use this cream after cleansing every morning and it literally leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky. It's even better when I apply after using Olay Regenerist micro dermabrasion treatment land peel activating serum. I'll the products I use on my face from cleansing to eye treatment is Olay and I have been for years. I am 62 but look 10 years younger because my skin is so soft and what wrinkles I do have are very shallow. Love, love, love. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
"Love my skin again, because it's smoother and softer,my pores are less noticeable, and younger looking"
"I have used these products for years. My skin looks great. Although I find that sometimes I get a white residue on my face. I do get compliments on like, you look 40, I can't believe you are 50! I believe in Olay products and its results. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
Works well with skin contour hides blemishes and wrinkles
"Have help me look younger for 10 years. Great product for aging skin, recommended to people with heavy rinklles."
It's not greases and feels good on your skin. It also gives you a beautiful glow. I used it for about two weeks and saw a difference in in my complexion. I would recommend this product to everyone. I brought some for my sister she also loved it. Then she told her friend and now we all are using it and skin looks moor firm then ever
This product is amazing! Awesome work!! It actually works! That's sooooooooo cool!!!
The best product. Helps heal dry damaged skin dark circles around the eyes. Your skin will look amazing.
"I've only used it for one week, but I have been very impressed. Using the facial mask of my CPAP machine has caused the area around my nose, cheeks and eyes to become really dry, flaky, and raw looking. But after using the cream for one week, I noticed a drastic improvement to my skin. The areas that are irritated by my nose mask are no longer dry and flaky or red and raw. My skin look very fresh and moist. Other moisturizers that I tried made my face look greasy not at all the look I wanted. Thanks for making a product that does just what it is supposed to do. Love it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
This product is really helpful for dry rough skin and I use their product everyday
Great and amazing because it is more than useful like it is likely to change your life ego and appearance
"I have been having problems with dry skin around my chin area. I typically have dry skin anyway and wanted to try this product after using numerous other products that do not seem to help. It took about a week before I started noticing any difference plus, taking extra care on how I cleansed my face. This product is wonderful. I am now hooked after no longer having that tight itching and dry feeling I had. I recommend this product to anyone who really needs something for dry skin. Thank you.

You should really try this product because it's done so many wonders for me. My skin feels super smooth and looks so fantastic. For real this is the best thing I've ever used for my face
I originally lobe the way it smells and feels when I apply it to my skin. It has enough of what I needed. I recommend this to any person struggleing with dry skin!
I have tried everything from all natural to high end designer cosmetics. This is a rock solid product that does it claims!!! It's been part of my regiment for over ten years. I regularly try other products but it's always a waste of time and money!
"I have used Oil of Olay off and on, but I always go back to Olay. I use everyday under my make-up and many times as a night time moisturizer. My skin looks smooth and I have very few wrinkles or lines."
It moisturizes well. I could see the difference within a couple of days. It is slightly heavy so I only use it a night.
Very smooth to skin relaxing. It leaves a sensation that revitalizes the youth inside the skin
Very silly feeling but not oily. Has a soft clean smell to it.
This is a great product I even use it myself . My household won't even use anything else if it isn't olay brand.
Product is very nice and works very well got it when worked at factory and my skin had bad reaction to the oil we were using there. It cleared up rather quickly had made my skin feel amazing.
This product leaves my face smooth and glowing and smells super nice i just love it
Makes your skin so soft and has the best smell. If product is applied as directed then results should be positive
My life changed as my face started to glow. Everyone wanted to know the secret... Wasn't a secret after all. Women like sharing beauty tip. I look younger and feel confident.
I love it amazing on my skin is so smooth nd not crack at all
I have used this product for years and my skin is supple and has very few wrinkles. People constantly come up to me and comment on what lovely skin I have. I also have people commenting that I look 20 years younger than my actual age. I know my Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream has been a huge help in staying young looking. It is velvety and rich and my skin drinks it in. I love it! My foundation smooths on easily over my Hydrating Cream and my complexion has a dewy glow.

"This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft, smooth and non-greasy. I like the dispenser as it puts the lotion in my palm without contaminating the unused product by touching it with my fingers. Have found that I do not need a full pump of the product because that is way too much for covering my face and neck. Anyone who has dry skin should not hesitate to give this a try."

I have used several Olay products and have been pleased with them. However when my skin was getting really dry and flaky I knew I needed something hard core.
