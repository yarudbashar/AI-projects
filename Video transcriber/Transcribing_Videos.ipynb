exactly is generative AI when you content is created by artificial intelligence it's called generative AI this could involve generating texts and images as well as videos music or voices to do this you described in a chat dialogue box what do you want the AI to create this description is called a prompt the generative AI tools provide answers to all sorts of questions summarize complex information and generate diverse ideas quickly depending on how they are used they can create short stories paintings pieces of code or even musical compositions the foundation for this creation lies in large amounts of data that the AI system accesses to identify patterns and similarities the content produced by the AI is new it's often impressive and challenging to distinguish from things humans of made generative AI can also be misused in so cold is utilized to produce images or videos that seem real AI generated texts to recognize as machine made moreover the AI can provide answers that sound correct but are actually incorrect this is called hallucinating the quality of what's created depends on both the quality of the data used and the quality of the prompts given to effectively utilize generative AI we need to learn how to guide the tools with meaningful prompts and use them thoughtfully generative AI holds immense potential and can help us in many ways such as serving as a writing or Learning Partner however the AI should do the hard work and humans should be responsible for the facts\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!python
